# useful_bioinformatics_scripts
A small collection of scripts I have found useful when performing bioinformatic tasks. When code was not written by me, attribution is provided. 

```bash
bash batch_rename_folders.sh
```
Batch renames folders contained in a given directory. Relies on a tab-delimited file, indicated in the bash script, containing old_id in the first column and new_id in the second column.
